      We will write our programs in .py files (or "modules", to Python programmers). 

      There are other ways to write and run Python code as well, but we are going to stick with .py files to make it easier to save and edit our code.

        #Your first Python program!

        Our first program is going to do three things: 

        1. Ask for some input from the user of the program (that&rsquo;s you!)
        2. Store the information the user gives in a **variable**.
        3. Output information so the user can see it.

        We&rsquo;ll write our program in a file called **ex1_hello.py**.

        #Class Exercise 1: Write your first Python program!

        Here&rsquo;s what to do:

        1. Go to **File > New** to create a new .py file.
        2. Go to **File > Save As...** and save the file as **ex1_hello.py** in the **exercises** folder.
        3. Type the following two lines of code **exactly** as written:
        ```python
    name = raw_input('What is your name? ')
    print('Hello ' + name)
    ```
        4. Click the green "Run" button.

        #How did that go??

        First of all, you may have got some errors. This is a **PERFECTLY NORMAL** part of programming. Computers aren&rsquo;t as smart as you.

        Humans can read something that doesn&rsquo;t quite follow the rules of the language. Computers can&rsquo;t. Some typos in that code would cause it not to work (ie. missing a ")" or misspelling "print").

        Luckily, Python tries to help us figure out what happened. Error messages contain information about where an error occurred, and what kind of error it was. With practice, you can learn to read them.

        #What did we just do?

        You just wrote your first program!

        It contains 2 lines of code, and a bunch of different programming concepts:

        * functions: `raw_input` and `print`
        * variables: `name`
        * strings: `'What is your name?'` and `'Hello'`. Your name was stored as a string too.

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Functions &amp; Variables

        In programming, we want to be able to take some of the work we&rsquo;ve done and store it somewhere for later, with a name or label to refer to it by. 

        * Functions refer to chunks of code. There are LOTS of functions that already exist in Python, and we&rsquo;ll use some of them today.
        * Variables refer to pieces of information that we want to work with. In this example, the variable `name` was used to refer to whatever you entered as your name. 


        <aside class="notes">
          You can also write your own functions, but we won&rsquo;t do that today
        </aside>

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #More on Functions

        * Functions are bundles of instructions that can be re-used
        * Reusing functions helps to reduce redundancy
        * Function can take **arguments** and can **return** values
        
        It is possible to create your own but today&rsquo;s exercises will use functions provided by Python and its libraries.

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Functions we just used

        We used two functions in our first program:

        1. `print`: We&rsquo;ll use this one a lot today to see the result of whatever we just computed. Notice how we put quotes around `"Hello "` and not around `name` in our program. In general, put quotes around things you want to be printed exactly as is, and no quotes around variables.

        2. `raw_input`: This function pauses the program and waits for the user to type something. This is useful for now, but we will soon look at a better way to get information into our programs.

        <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Reassigning Variables

        Variables can be changed after the initial declaration by "reassigning" them.

        We could change our original program to:

        ```python
        name = raw_input('What is your name? ')
        print('I think', name, 'is not your real name...')
        name = raw_input('What is your real name? ')
        print('Hello', name)
        ```

        We are using the same variable <code>name</code> to refer to the second thing entered as well. 

        Note that when we change a variable, we lose the old thing it referred to. Just make sure that is what you want to do!

        #What&rsquo;s in a name?
        
        Here are some tips & best practices for creating variable names:
        
        * variable names can only use letters, numbers and the underscore (`_`)
          * no spaces!
        * separate words with the underscore `_` symbol
          * e.g. `ladies_learning_code`
        * they cannot begin with a number
          * `1day` gives you an error, `day1` will work.
        * descriptive names will make future you happier
          * e.g. `first_name` is more descriptive than `fn`

        #Data Types

        The previous example used the *string* **type** but there are many more.

        * Integer (`int`, whole numbers)
        * Float (`float`, numbers containing decimals)
        * String (`str`, words, sentences, literal text)
        * Boolean (`True`, `False`)
        * [and many more!](http://www.diveintopython3.net/native-datatypes.html)

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Concatenation
        **Concatenation** is used to "add" strings together by joining multiple strings into one.
        ```python
        print("Hello " + "World!") # --> prints Hello World!
        ```

        But what if we try to join a string and a number?

        ```python
        print(2 + "2")
        ```
        It would produce something like this: 
        ```
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Why did that error happen?

        Python needs to know the data **type** to work with it.  
        
        Let&rsquo;s look at that error again.

        ```python
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
        ```
        
        The first `2` is an `int` and the second `"2"` is a `str`.
        
        Python doesn&rsquo;t know whether you wanted to *add two numbers* or *concatenate two strings*. Instead of guessing, it forces you to be **explicit**.

      </script>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Typecasting
        
        In Python, you can *change the type*. 
        
        In this example, the `int()` function can be used to convert the `"2"` string into a number.

        ```
        print(2 + int("2")) # --> prints 4
        ```
        

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Typecasting (Continued)

        Python can also be used to convert numbers to strings. This example...

        ```
        print(99 + " bottles of beer on the wall")
        ```
        will produce (something like) this error...
        ```
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
        ```
        
        Use the `str()` function to convert a number to a string.

        ```
        print(str(99) + " bottles of beer on the wall")
        ```
        
        The ability to tell Python to change the type will come in handy later.

        #Pro Tip: Use Comments!

        Programmers use *comments* to leave notes for themselves (and other people reading their code in the future):

        ```
        # This is a comment!
        ```
        
        Good comments add information that isn&rsquo;t immediately obvious.
        
        You can also use comments to organize your code or to &rsquo;hide&rsquo; chunks of code you don&rsquo;t want to delete but are not ready to use yet. Feel free to add your own throughout the exercises!
        
        Note the syntax below:

        # Python will ignore anything after the # symbol
        ```

        #Conditionals &amp; Logic

        The program we just wrote ran straight from top to bottom. What if the program could decide what to do instead?
        
        `if` statements can be used to execute different sets of instructions based on specific conditions.
        
        Each `if` statement contains a test. The indented block of code will run if the test is `True`:

        ```python
        if weather == "cold":
            print("Wear a sweater!")
        ```

        `elif` statemens can be added after an `if` statement to test for other things:

        ```python

        elif weather == "raining":
            print("Bring an umbrella")

        And a final `else` statement can be added, which run if none of the `if` or `elif` tests before it passed:

        When writing `if` statements, Python needs you to be quite particular about indentation. 

        Python gets a little bit upset when it doesn&rsquo;t get the indentation it expects:

        ```python
        if weather == "cold":
            print("Wear a sweater!")

        #Equality

        What's that `==` doing? It's the *equality operator*, read "equals".

        It evalutes to `True` if the left hand side is equal to the right hand side:

        ```
        weather = "raining"
        print(weather == "cold") # --> prints False
        print(weather == "raining") # --> prints True
        ```

        The `!=` operator — read "not equals" — does the opposite:

        ```
        print(4 != 3) # --> prints True
        print(4 != 4) # --> prints False
        ```

        #Equality continued...

        Reminder: one equals sign is used for *assignment*, two for *equality*.

        This code creates a variable called `weather` that refers to the string `"raining"`:
        ```python
        weather = "raining"
        ```
        and this code checks to see if the variable `weather` refers to the string `"raining"` or not. It is either True or False.
        ```
        weather == "raining"
        ```

        Make a guess at each of these questions then try it to see if you&rsquo;re right:

        * Does case matter? (does `"david" == "David"`?)
        * What happens when numbers and strings are compared? (does `4 == "4"`?)
        * What happens when `float`s and `int`s are compared? (does `float(4) == int(4)`)?

        We&rsquo;ll also be using the mathematical greater than and less than operators:

        `<`, `<=`: less than, less than or equal to

        ```python

        #Getting MORE data into our programs

        So far, we have provided all of the input to our program by typing it in when the `raw_input` function was called. 

        This is *NOT* how we want to do things when we have lots of data!

        Now we will look at reading data from files into our programs. What we do today will work for any kind of **plain-text** file, like .txt, .csv, and so on.

        Computer data is often stored in files such **.csv** (comma-separated values) files.  
        These file types are used to represent spreadsheet-like data.
        
        Let&rsquo;s look at the example below to see how to open these files in Python and print the contents to the screen. 
        
        In your `sandbox.py`, try adding the below commands.

        ```python
        weather_file = open('./simple_weather.csv')
        print(weather_file.read())
        weather_file.close()
        # When you are done with a file it is a good idea to close it
        ```

        When you run this, you should see a lot of stuff printed.

        #Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Files

        To make use of the data in a file, we need to make sense of small portions at a time.
        In the `simple_weather.csv` file, each line of the file represents a day and its temperature.

        Let&rsquo;s try printing out a few individual lines using the example below.

        ```python
        weather_file = open('./simple_weather.csv')
        print(weather_file.next())
        print(weather_file.next())

        In the previous slide we printed out three lines in the file, one at a time.  
        Notice that all three lines have exactly three values, separated by a comma.

        ```python
        Month,temp,condition
        Jan,cold,snowing
        Feb,cold,sunny
        ```
        
        * the first line shows the headings that describe the data in the next lines
        * the second and third line each represent one weather record

        #Loops: Reading all the lines in a file
        
        We&rsquo;ve just seen how to print out one line of a time but what if you need to read all the lines in the file?

        In programming, to perform the same action many times in a row, **loops** are used.  
        In Python, try using the `for` loop to print each of the rows in the file. 
        
        Here&rsquo;s some sample code:

        ```python
        weather_file = open('./simple_weather.csv')
        for line in weather_file:
            print(line)
        weather_file.close()
        ```

        #`for` loop behind the scenes

        The `for` loop works by calling `.next()` over and over again.

        Behind the scenes, it&rsquo;s doing something roughly like:

        ```python
        while there are lines left:
          line = weather_file.next()
          # Execute your code block
        ```

        Python calls anything with a `.next()` method an _iterator_, and it can _iterate_ over a whole bunch of different things!

        We can iterate over strings too.

        ```python
        llc = "LLC"
        for c in "LLC":
            print("Letter: " + c)
        # --> prints the following lines
        # Letter: L
        # Letter: L
        # Letter: C
        ```

        `for` loops are very useful whenever we are working with large files!

        #Checking for text in a line

        One thing we might want to do is check if a line contains a certain piece of text.

        To do this, we can use the `in` operator to produce a True or False value.

        For example, the code `"sunny" in line` will be True if `"sunny"` is part of the text on `line`.

        We can use this with an if statement to only do something in our program if a line contains particular text.

        #Breaking Lines into Pieces

        What if we only wanted to print part of a line?

        Here, we need a couple new things:

        1. A function called `split`, which splits a line (a string!) up into pieces, based on some separator. 

        2. A new Python type called a *list*. Lists are ordered collections of stuff. We can access each piece on its own.

        So, if we could take the line `"Feb,cold,sunny"` and split it at commas:

        ```python
        data = "Feb,cold,sunny".split(',')
        print(data) # --> prints ["Feb", "cold", "sunny"]
        ```
        We are telling the `split` function to break the line up by commas, and what is printed is a list.

        Once we have the list `["Feb", "cold", "sunny"], we can work with the individual elements.

        For example, if we could update our program from Exercise 4 to only print out the months that are warm, rather than the whole row.

        To do that, we can do what is called *indexing* into a list. We just say which position we want, inside of square brackets, ie. `data[1]`.

        One thing we can do with lists is collect a bunch of datapoints, and then analyze them together.

        ```python
        data_list = []

        data_list.append(-2)
        data_list.append(6)

        # Math on lists

        Python has some functions that do different operations on lists of numbers.

        For example, we can use the functions `max`, `min`, and `sum` to find the maximum value, minimum value, and the sum of values in a list. 

        ```python
        data_list = [4, -2, 6]
        max_value = max(data_list) # careful about naming variables 'max'
        min_value = min(data_list) # same with 'min'
        sum_of_values = sum(data_list)
        print "Max:", max_value, "Min:", min_value, "Sum:", sum_of_values 
            # --> prints Max: 6 Min: -2 Sum: 8
        ```

        There is no function to find average, but there is one for length, so we could find the average of a list of numbers using `sum` and `len`, and dividing the results:
        ```python
        average = sum(data_list) / len(data_list)

        Sometimes you want to keep track of the number of times something happened.

        Along with numbers, strings, and lists, dictionaries — `dict`s — are one of Python&rsquo;s fundamental types.

        Dictionaries associate *keys* with *values*. For example:

        ```python
        person = {'name': 'David Wolever', 'twitter': '@wolever', 'following': 735}
        ```

        And you use *square braces* to look up the value associated with a key:

        ```python
        print(person['name'])
        print(person['following'])
        ```

        will output

        You can think of the values as the data, and the keys as labels for each piece of data.

        #Counting with Dictionaries
        
        In addition to reading values from dictionaries you can also assign to them, just like you would with variables:

        ```python
        counts = {}
        counts['a'] = 0
        counts['a'] += 1
        print(counts) # --> prints {'a': 1}
        ```

        And you can use the `in` operator to see if a particular key is `in` the dictionary. The statement `'a' in counts` is True, and the statement `'b' in counts` is False.

        #Counting things you don&rsquo;t expect!

        So far we have had to define one variable for each "thing" we wanted to count… but what happens when we can&rsquo;t do that ahead of time?

        For example, what happens if we want to count the number of weather records for each month?
        
        We can use dictionaries!

        ```python
        month_counts = {}
        for line in weather_file
          month = line.strip().split(',')[1]
          if month in month_counts:
            month_counts += 1
          else:
            month_counts[month] = 1
        ```

      #Writing to files

      So far everything we did went to the screen. This might be enough for you, but you can also write your own files.

      To open a file to write to it, we have to add `"w"`:
      ```python
      new_file = open("my_new_file.csv", "w")
      ```

      Then, there is a function called `write` that will write whatever string you give it to a file. 

      ```python
      new_file.write(line_to_write + "\n") # "\n" is like hitting Enter after each line
      ```

      You also really need to close files (ie. `new_file.close()`) after you are completely finished writing to them.

        So far, we&rsquo;ve used small examples to practice using CSV files and recognizing patterns.

        One of our datasets is the participants and volunteers in Ladies Learning Code events in 2015. Do you want to count those?

        #Final Exercise!

        Your final project will be to learn something about a dataset. We have provided a few for you, and some questions to get you started, but feel free to try something else!

        `../datasets/llc-workshop-data.csv`: This dataset represents the people who participated in Ladies Learning Code events in 2015. Some things to find out:

          * How many people signed up for "National Learn to Code Day"?
          * Total number of people registerd in youth-oriented "National Learn to Code Day" (ie. "Kids" and "Girls")

        `../datasets/historic_sites.csv`: This dataset represents the names and locations of historic sites in Canada.

          * How many are in each province? (Watch for some bad data...)
          * What is the name of the northernmost historic site?

        `../datasets/dairy.csv`: This dataset represents some historic data about dairy production in Canada.

          * Which decade produced the most butter?
          * Anything else really...

        #Bonus Exercise: Open Data Hackathon

        You can find a few more datasets in the `datasets` folder. Most of this data came from open.canada.ca, where you can find more data than you can handle!
        
        **Pro tip!** Open the .csv data in a program like Excel or [LibreOffice Spreadsheet](https://www.libreoffice.org/) to see the data.
        
        * Can you identify any interesting patterns?
        * What are you interested in learning from the data?
        * What do you want the output to be?
        
        Take the consumer vehicle [Fuel Consumption Ratings](http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64). 
        You could filter out all the vehicles that require less than 10l per 100km (cheaper and greener cars).

        #Things we didn&rsquo;t cover
        
        ##Using Python libraries to help with our analysis
        
        * There is a LOT of code out there that people have written do to more complicated data analysis and file processing for you... and you can just use it!
        
        ##Reading files in other languages (like French)
        
        * Python 2.x defaults to ASCII (very basic letters and numbers)
        * Most text on the internet with accents or foreign characters (Arabic, Chinese, etc.) are represented in [unicode](http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding.en)
        * You can install the [unicodecsv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unicodecsv/0.13.0) package with [pip](http://www.dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-python/) and it will read and write CSV files containing accents and other characters
