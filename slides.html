        * Computers need *very specific* instructions
        * Programming languages have syntax, just like human languages have grammar rules
        * One big difference: humans can pretty easily figure out meaning of sentences that don&rsquo;t quite follow the rules of the language... computers aren&rsquo;t that smart.

      #Writing Python Programs

      We will write our programs in .py files (or "modules", to Python programmers). 

      There are other ways to write and run Python code as well, but we are going to stick with .py files to make it easier to save and edit our code.

        #Your first Python program!

        Our first program is going to do three things: 

        1. Ask for some input from the user of the program (that&rsquo;s you!)
        2. Store the information the user gives in a **variable**.
        3. Output information so the user can see it.

        We&rsquo;ll write our program in a file called **ex1.py**.

        #Class Exercise 1: Write your first Python program!

        Here&rsquo;s what to do:

        1. Go to File -> New to create a new .py file.
        2. Go to File -> Save As... and save the file as **ex1.py** in the **exercises** folder.
        3. Type the following two lines of code **exactly** as written:
        <pre>
    name = raw_input('What is your name? ')
    print('Hello', name)
    </pre>
        4. Click the green "Run" button.

        #How did that go??

        First of all, you may have got some errors. This is a **PERFECTLY NORMAL** part of programming. Computers aren&rsquo;t as smart as you.

        Humans can read something that doesn&rsquo;t quite follow the rules of the language. Computers can&rsquo;t. Some typos in that code would cause it not to work (ie. missing a ")" or misspelling "print").

        Luckily, Python tries to help us figure out what happened. Error messages contain information about where an error occurred, and what kind of error it was. With practice, you can learn to read them.

        #What did we just do?

        You just wrote your first program!

        It contains 2 lines of code, and a bunch of different programming concepts:

        * functions: raw_input and print
        * variables: name
        * strings: 'What is your name?' and 'Hello'. Your name was stored as a string too.

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Functions &amp; Variables

        In programming, we want to be able to take some of the work we&rsquo;ve done and store it somewhere for later. Functions are names we can use to refer to chunks of code that either we, or someone else, has written. There are LOTS of functions that already exist in Python, and we&rsquo;ll use some of them today.

        Variables are names we can use to refer to pieces of information that we want to work with. In this example, the variable name was used to refer to whatever you entered as your name. 

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #More on Functions

        * Functions are bundles of instructions that can be re-used
        * Reusing functions helps to reduce redundancy
        * Function can take **arguments** and can **return** values
        
        It is possible to create your own but today&rsquo;s exercises will use functions provided by Python and its libraries.

        We used two functions in our first program:

        1. <code>print</code>: We&rsquo;ll use this one a lot today to see the result of whatever we just computed. Notice how we put quotes around "Hello " and not around <code>name</code> in our program. In general, put quotes around things you want to be printed exactly as is, and no quotes around variables.

        2. <code>raw_input</code>: This function pauses the program and waits for the user to type something. This is useful for now, but we will soon look at a better way to get information into our programs.

        #Reassigning Variables

        Variables can be changed after the initial declaration by "reassigning" them.

        We could change our original program to:

        ```python
        name = raw_input('What is your name? ')
        print('I think', name, 'is not your real name...')
        name = raw_input('What is your real name? ')
        print('Hello', name)
        ```

        We are using the same variable <code>name</code> to refer to the second thing entered as well. 

        Note that when we change a variable, we lose the old thing it referred to. Just make sure that is what you want to do!

        #What&rsquo;s in a name?
        
        Here are some tips & best practices for creating variable names:
        
        * variable names can only use letters, numbers and the underscore (`_`)
          * no spaces!
        * separate words with the underscore `_` symbol
          * e.g. `ladies_learning_code`
        * they cannot begin with a number
          * `1day` gives you an error, `day1` will work.
        * descriptive names will make future you happier
          * e.g. `first_name` is more descriptive than `fn`

        #Data Types

        The previous example used the *string* **type** but there are many more.

        * Integer (`int`, whole numbers)
        * Float (`float`, numbers containing decimals)
        * String (`str`, words, sentences, literal text)
        * Boolean (`True`, `False`)

        #Concatenation
        **Concatenation** is used to "add" strings together by joining multiple strings into one.
        ```python
        print("Hello " + "World!")
        ```
        would output 
        ```python
        Hello World!
        ```
        
        <br>
        But what if we try to join a string and a number?

        ```python
        print(2 + "2")
        ```
        would produce something like
        ```
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>

        #Why did that error happen?

        Python needs to know the data **type** to work with it.  
        
        Let&rsquo;s look at that error again.

        ```python
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
        ```
        
        <br>
        The first `2` is an `int` and the second `"2"` is a `str`.
        
        Python doesn&rsquo;t know whether you wanted to *add two numbers* or *concatenate two strings*. Instead of guessing, it forces you to be **explicit**.

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Typecasting
        
        In Python, you can *change the type*. 
        
        In this example, the `int()` function can be used to convert the `"2"` string into a number.

        ```
        print(2 + int("2"))
        ```
        would output
        ```
        4
        ```

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Typecasting (Continued)

        Python can also be used to convert numbers to strings. This example...

        ```
        print(99 + " bottles of beer on the wall")
        ```
        will produce (something like) this error...
        ```
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
        ```
        
        <br>
        Use the `str()` function to convert a number to a string.

        ```
        print(str(99) + " bottles of beer on the wall")
        ```
        
        <br>
        The ability to tell Python to change the type will come in handy later.

        #Pro Tip: Use Comments!

        Programmers use *comments* to leave notes for themselves (and other people reading their code in the future):

        ```
        # This is a comment!
        ```
        
        Good comments add information that isn&rsquo;t immediately obvious.
        
        You can also use comments to organize your code or to &rsquo;hide&rsquo; chunks of code you don&rsquo;t want to delete but are not ready to use yet. Feel free to add your own throughout the exercises!
        
        Note the syntax below:

        ```
        # Python will ignore anything after the # symbol
        ```

        #Conditionals &amp; Logic

        The program we just wrote ran straight from top to bottom. What if the program could decide what to do instead?
        
        `if` statements can be used to execute different sets of instructions based on specific conditions.
        
        Each `if` statement contains a test. The indented block of code will run if the test is `True`:

        ```python
        if weather == "cold":
            print("Wear a sweater!")
        ```

        `elif` statemens can be added after an `if` statement to test for other things:

        ```python
        if weather == "cold":
            print("Wear a sweater!")
        elif weather == "raining":
            print("Bring an umbrella")
        ```

        And a final `else` statement can be added, which run if none of the `if` or `elif` tests before it passed:

        ```python
        if weather == "cold":
            print("Wear a sweater!")
        elif weather == "raining":
            print("Bring an umbrella")

        When writing `if` statements, Python needs you to be quite particular about indentation.

        ```python
        if weather == "cold":
            print("Wear a sweater!")
        else:

        #Equality

        What's that `==` doing? It's the *equality operator*, read "equals".

        It evalutes to `True` if the left hand side is equal to the right hand side:

        ```
        weather = "raining"
        print(weather == "cold")
        print(weather == "raining")

        ```python
        False
        True
        ```

        The `!=` operator â€” read "not equals" â€” does the opposite:

        ```
        print(4 != 3)
        print(4 != 4)
        ```
        outputs
        ```

        #Equality continued...

        Reminder: one equals sign is used for *assignment*, two for *equality*.

        This code creates a variable called `weather` that refers to the string `"raining"`:
        ```python
        weather = "raining"
        ```
        and this code checks to see if the variable `weather` refers to the string `"raining"` or not. It is either True or False.
        ```
        weather == "raining"
        ```

        Make a guess at each of these questions then try it to see if you&rsquo;re right:

        * Does case matter? (does `"david" == "David"`?)
        * What happens when numbers and strings are compared? (does `4 == "4"`?)
        * What happens when `float`s and `int`s are compared? (does `float(4) == int(4)`)?

        We&rsquo;ll also be using the mathematical greater than and less than operators:

        `<`, `<=`: less than, less than or equal to

        #Getting MORE data into our programs

        So far, we have provided all of the input to our program by typing it in when the `raw_input` function was called. 

        This is *NOT* how we want to do things when we have lots of data!

        Now we will look at reading data from files into our programs. What we do today will work for any kind of **plain-text** file, like .txt, .csv, and so on.

        Computer data is often stored in files such **.csv** (comma-separated values) files.  
        These file types are used to represent spreadsheet-like data.
        
        Let&rsquo;s look at the example below to see how to open these files in Python and print the contents to the screen. 
        
        In your `sandbox.py`, try adding the below commands.

        ```python
        weather_file = open('./exercises/simple_weather.csv')
        print(weather_file.read())
        weather_file.close()
        # When you are done with a file it is a good idea to close it

        #Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Files

        To make use of the data in a file, we need to make sense of small portions at a time.
        In the `simple_weather.csv` file, each line of the file represents a day and its temperature.

        Let&rsquo;s try printing out a few individual lines using the example below.

        ```python
        weather_file = open('./exercises/simple_weather.csv')
        print(weather_file.next())
        print(weather_file.next())

        ```python

        #Loops: Reading all the lines in a file
        
        We&rsquo;ve just seen how to print out one line of a time but what if you need to read all the lines in the file?

        In programming, to perform the same action many times in a row, **loops** are used.  
        In Python, try using the `for` loop to print each of the rows in the file. 
        
        Here&rsquo;s some sample code:

        ```python
        weather_file = open('./exercises/simple_weather.csv')
        for line in weather_file:
            print(line)
        weather_file.close()
        ```

        #`for` loop behind the scenes

        The `for` loop works by calling `.next()` over and over again.

        Behind the scenes, it&rsquo;s doing something roughly like:

        ```python
        while there are lines left:
          line = weather_file.next()
          # Execute your code block
        ```

        Python calls anything with a `.next()` method an _iterator_, and it can _iterate_ over a whole bunch of different things!

        ```python
        >>> llc = iter("LLC")
        >>> llc.next()
        'L'
        >>> llc.next()
        'L'
        >>> llc.next()
        'C'
        >>> for c in "LLC":
        ...     print("Letter: " + c)
        ...
        Letter: L
        Letter: L
        Letter: C
        ```

        `for` loops are very useful whenever we are working with large files!

        #Checking for text in a line

        One thing we might want to do is check if a line contains a certain piece of text.

        To do this, we can use the `in` operator to produce a True or False value.

        For example, the code `"sunny" in line` will be True if `"sunny"` is part of the text on `line`.

        We can use this with an if statement to only do something in our program if a line contains particular text.

        #Breaking Lines into Pieces

        What if we only wanted to print part of a line?

        Here, we need a couple new things:

        1. A function called `split`, which splits a line (a string!) up into pieces, based on some separator. 

        2. A new Python type called a *list*. Lists are ordered collections of stuff. We can access each piece on its own.

        So, if we were to take the line `"Feb,cold,sunny"` and split it...

        ```
        data = "Feb,cold,sunny".split()
        print(data)
        ```
        then our output would look like this:

        Once we have the list `["Feb", "cold", "sunny"], we can work with the individual elements.

        For example, if we could update our program from Exercise 5 to only print out the months that are warm, rather than the whole row.

        To do that, we can do what is called *indexing* into a list. We just say which position we want, inside of square brackets, ie. `data[1]`.

        ```python
        data = ["Feb", "cold", "sunny"]
        print(data[0])
        print(data[2])

        #Reading data from a CSV file

        The CSV library has a number of different tools for extracting data from a CSV file. Instead of a line of comma-separated values like in the previous example, we can access individual values (like the cells of a spreadsheet).

        Today we&rsquo;ll mostly use the `DictReader` tool to access the values.
        
        1. import the `csv` library
        1. open the file
        1. pass the file into `DictReader`

        ```
        >>> import csv
        >>> chapters_file = open('./exercises/llc-chapters.csv')
        >>> chapters_data = csv.DictReader(chapters_file)
        ```
        
        Now, we can pull out one row at a time.

        ```
        >>> chapter = chapters_data.next()
        >>> print(chapter)
        {'City': 'Vancouver', 'Chapter Lead(s)': 'Meghan', 'Province': 'BC'}
        >>> type(chapter)
        <type 'dict'>

        #Dictionaries
        
        Along with numbers and strings, dictionaries â€” `dict`s â€” are one of Python&rsquo;s fundamental types.

        Dictionaries associate *keys* with *values*. For example:

        ```python
        >>> person = {'name': 'David Wolever', 'twitter': '@wolever', 'following': 735}
        >>> type(person)
        <type 'dict'>
        ```

        And you use *square braces* to look up the value associated with a key:

        ```python
        >>> person['name']
        'David Wolever'
        >>> person['following']
        735
        ```

        Dictionaries are a simple way to bundle up a bunch of information into one place.

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Using the DictReader
        
        The `csv.DictReader` returns a dictionary for each line in the CSV file, where the keys are the CSV headers and the values are the associated values in each line.

        For example, as before:

        ```python
        >>> chapter = chapters_data.next()
        >>> print(chapter)
        {'City': 'Vancouver', 'Chapter Lead(s)': 'Meghan', 'Province': 'BC'}

        Vancouver

        #Working in a `for` loop
      
        Earlier, we learned how `for` loops can repeat the same set of instructions. Let&rsquo;s take a look at this example below.

        * the `for` loop assigns *each row* to the `chapter` variable
        * instructions are grouped together by giving them the same indentation
        * all the instructions in the indented block are run for each `chapter`
        * remember to press enter again after the last instruction in the for loop to execute it

        ```python
        >>> import csv
        >>> chapters_file = open('./exercises/llc-chapters.csv')
        >>> chapters = csv.DictReader(chapters_file)
        >>> for chapter in chapters:
        ...     print(chapter['City'] + ', ' + chapter['Province'])
        ...     print('    ' + chapter['Chapter Lead(s)'])
        ...

        #Exercise 4: Find your chapter lead (15 mins)

        You already have the tools you need to find your chapter lead(s) in `llc-chapters.csv`.
        
        In the **exercises** folder, open **ex4_chapter_lead_finder.py** and follow the instructions listed in the comments. Try applying the concepts covered so far.

        ```python
        # Import the csv library
        import csv
        
        # Open the 'llc-chapters.csv' file

        # Loop through each of the rows
        
            # Compare the 'City' in the row with your city
        
            Â Â Â Â # Print "Thank you [[Chapter Lead(s)]]!"

        #Counting loops

        Sometimes you want to keep track of the number of times something happened. 

        We can add `1` to the current value of a variable, and assign it back to the same variable. Python processes everything to the right of the `=` before assigning the result.

        ```python
        >>> count = 0
        >>> count = count + 1
        >>> print(count)
        1
        ```
        
        Count the number of chapters in **llc-chapters.csv** by adding one each time it loops.

        ```python
        # file: exercises/demo_loop_count.py
        import csv

        csv_file = open('llc-chapters.csv')
        csv_data = csv.DictReader(csv_file)

        chapter_count = 0
        for row in csv_data:
            chapter_count += 1

        print("There are " + str(chapter_count) + " chapters")

        #Finding a word in a string

        So far, we&rsquo;ve compared entire strings to each other `"Python" == "Python"`. But what if you want to find a word inside an existing string?

        The `haystack.find(needle)` method can be used with strings to tell you where the string `needle` starts in the `haystack`:

        ```python
        >>> "abcd".find("b")
        1
        >>> hello = "Hello, world!"
        >>> hello.find("Hello")
        0
        >>> hello.find("Python")
        -1
        ```

        Notice that the first starting position is `0`, not `1` like you might expect!

        Make a guess at each of these questions then try it to see if you&rsquo;re right:

        * Is `.find(â€¦)` case sensitive?
        * What happens if some of the `needle` appears in the haystack but not all of it?
        * What happens if you try to `.find(â€¦)` a number?

        #Exercise 5: Find chapters with co-leads (15 mins)

        In the **llc-chapters.csv** file, the `&` character is used to separate the co-lead names.
        
        You can use `.find(â€¦)` to look for a string within a string, to figure out which cities have co-leads.

        Remember, `.find(â€¦)` returns the index of the search string in the other string **or** `-1` to signal nothing was found. Try using the `>=` operator to determine if the string was found.

        ```python
        >>> leads = "Nancy & Cassie"
        >>> if leads.find("&") >= 0:
        ...     print(leads + " are co-leads")
        ... 
        Nancy & Cassie are co-leads
        ```

        Create a new file, **ex5_coleaders.py**, and use what you&rsquo;ve learned so far to find which chapter cities have co-leads.
        
        * Print a list of cities with co-leads 
        * Count how many chapters have co-leads

        #More on Dictionaries
        
        In addition to reading values from dictionaries you can also assign to them, just like you would with variables:

        ```python
        >>> counts = {}
        >>> counts['a'] = 0
        {'a': 0}
        >>> counts['a'] += 1
        >>> counts
        {'a': 1}
        ```

        And you can use the `in` operator to see if a particular key is `in` the dictionary:

        ```python
        >>> 'a' in counts
        True
        >>> 'b' in counts
        False

        #Counting things you don&rsquo;t expect!

        So far we have had to define one variable for each "thing" we wanted to countâ€¦ but what happens when we can&rsquo;t do that ahead of time?

        For example, what happens if we want to count the number of chapters in each province?
        
        We can use dictionaries!

        ```python
        >>> province_counts = {}
        >>> for chapter in csv.DictReader(open('./exercises/llc-chapters.csv'))
        ...     province = chapter['Province']
        ...     if province in province_counts:
        ...       province_counts[province] += 1
        ...     else:
        ...       province_counts[province] = 1
        ...
        >>> print province_counts
        {'ON': 6, 'AB': 2, 'BC': 2, 'QC': 2, 'NL': 1, 'MB': 1, 'NB': 1, 'SK': 1, 'NS': 1}

        #A Few Last String Examples

        Before we move on to the project, there are a couple things you should know about strings:

        The `.split(â€¦)` method can be used to split strings in to parts:

        ```python
        >>> names = "Allegra & David"
        >>> names.split("&")
        ['Allegra ', ' David']
        >>> for name in names.split("&"):
        ...    print("Name: " + name)
        ...
        Name: Allegra 
        Name:  David
        ```

        The `.strip()` method removes spaces from the beginning / end of strings:

        ```python
        >>> for name in names.split("&"):
        ...    print("Name: " + name.strip())
        ...
        Name: Allegra 
        Name: David
        ```

        The `.lower()` and `.upper()` methods make strings lower and upper case:

        ```python
        >>> print "Hello, " + name.lower()
        Hello, david
        >>> print "Hello, " + name.upper()
        Hello, DAVID
        ```

        In 2014, Ladies Learning Code had nearly 6500 participants and volunteers involved in events (and not accounting for people who attended multiple events). Do you want to count those?

        In order to promote **National Learn to Code Day 2015**, and measure its success relative to 2014, we&rsquo;ll need some stats:
        
        * number of people signed up for "National Learn to Code Day"
        * total number of people registered for "Kids Learning Code" events or 
        * total number of people registered for "Girls Learning Code" events

        #Bonus Exercise: Open Data Hackathon
        
        If you want to use different data, there are lots available for public use. The Government of Canada has many data sets available. Here are a few [suggested data sets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14fFZPKrb0RrKpjiAQYshwT3iYkTRGKeeFcpz3r8m8Qg) 
        including registered charities, population estimates, consumer price data, and more.
        
        **Pro tip!** Open the data in program like Excel or [LibreOffice Spreadsheet](https://www.libreoffice.org/) to see the data.
        
        * Can you identify any interesting patterns?
        * What are you interested in learning from the data?
        * What do you want the output to be?
        
        So far we&rsquo;ve seen examples where the output goes to the screen, but you might simply want to filter out a smaller
        set of results and write them back to a new CSV (see `reference/writing_csv.py` for an example).
        
        Take the consumer vehicle [Fuel Consumption Ratings](http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64). 
        You could filter out all the vehicles that require less than 10l per 100km (cheaper and greener cars).

        #Things we didn't cover
        
        ##Writing results to a CSV file
        
        * Just like `DictReader` there's a `DictWriter` in the csv package
        * Gather data then write out the headers and data to a file
        * Useful for filtering a big set of data down to something you can analyse in a spreadsheet program
        * See `reference/writing_csv.py`
        
        ##Reading files in other languages (like French)
        
        * Python 2.x defaults to ASCII (very basic letters and numbers)
        * Most text on the internet with accents or foreign characters (Arabic, Chinese, etc.) are represented in [unicode](http://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding.en)
        * You can install the [unicodecsv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unicodecsv/0.13.0) package with [pip](http://www.dabapps.com/blog/introduction-to-pip-and-virtualenv-python/) and it will read and write CSV files containing accents and other characters
