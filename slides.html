        # Today&rsquo;s project

        Imagine you&rsquo;re organizing **National Learn to Code Day 2015**. 

        ![](framework/img/workshop/learn-to-code-day.jpg) <!-- .element: class="col-2" -->

        You want it to be an *even bigger success* than last year, so not only do you need to know how many people attended (so you can beat that target), but you also want to pull other salient stats to put in a press release.

        News outlets *love* stats. 

        <!-- Computers are very good at repetitive tasks, but they require *precise instructions*. -->

        Today, you&rsquo;ll learn to 'think' like a computer as you gather insights into who attended Ladies Learning Code workshops in 2014.

        <div class="presenter-notes">
          Whether you take these tools and apply them to your own data or keep using the tools you know, by the end of the day, you&rsquo;ll hopefully have greater confidence in leveraging computers to do your work faster and focus on what matters to you.

        ## What is programming?

        * Programming is giving instructions to your computer to get it to do things for you
        * Computers need *very specific* instructions
        * We use a programming language to give the computer instructions in a form that it can understand
        * Programming languages have syntax, just like human languages do

        <br>
        ## Why Python Is Awesome

        *   Free
        *   Open source
        *   Write once, run anywhere
        *   Great community
        *   The syntax looks like English

        ## Running Python in PyCharm

        The console is an interactive tool used to test and debug code and it&rsquo;s included in PyCharm!

        Let&rsquo;s open the console: 

        ![Tools &gt; Python Console&hellip;](./framework/img/workshop/open-console1.png)

        The console will pop up at the bottom of the application. Python is now ready to do your bidding...

        ![Python Console in PyCharm](./framework/img/workshop/open-console2.png)

        Now you can type code after the green `>>>` symbol. It is used by the console to represent a space for you to enter your input but you don&rsquo;t have to actually type it.  You can also open and close the console by selecting the icon in the lower right of PyCharm.

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Python can do math

        In the console, after the `>>>`, try out these examples.  

        The command you input after the `>>>` gets *evaluated* and a value is returned back to you.

        ```
        >>> 2 + 2
        4
        ```

        ```
        >>> 2 * 15
        30
        ```

        ```
        >>> 1 / 2
        0
        ```
        Why is `1 / 2 = 0`? We&rsquo;ll come back to that.

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Data Types

        We just used the *integer* number **type** but there are many more.

        * Integer (`int`, whole numbers)
        * Float (numbers containing decimals)
        * String (`str`, words, sentences, literal text)
        * Boolean (true, false)
        * list [and more!](http://www.diveintopython3.net/native-datatypes.html) 
        * Use `type()` and a data value inside the parentheses to figure out the type.

        ```
        >>> type("hello")
        <type 'str'>

        >>> type(42)
        <type 'int'>

        >>> type(3.14159)
        <type 'float'>

        >>> type([1, 2, 3, 4])
        <type 'list'>
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Printing

        The `print()` **function** outputs values to the screen. 

        Functions at its most basic definition holds a set of instructions. More on functions later. 

        Also, note the usage of quotes. 

        ```
        >>> print("Hello World!")
        Hello World!
        ```

        ```
        >>> print(2 + 2)
        4
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Concatenation
         You can "add" strings together, and that&rsquo;s called **concatenation**. It  joins multiple strings into one.
        ```
        >>> print("Hello " + "World!")
        Hello World!
        ```
        But what if we try to join a string and a number?

        ```python
        >>> print(2 + "2")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Why did that error happen?

        Python needs to know what **type** something is to figure out how to work with it.  Let&rsquo;s look at that error again.


        ```python
        >>> print(2 + "2")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
        ```

        * The first `2`, inside of `print(2 + "2")` is an integer.
        * `"2"` enclosed in the quotes, is a **string** type, or "literal text".
        * Python can&rsquo;t figure out how to add a number and string, so it spits out an error.

      </script>
    </section>

<!-- -------------------- -->
<!--Typecasting-->
<!-- -------------------- -->

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Typecasting

        We can tell Python how to convert that `"2"` into a number and **change the type**. In this case, change the string to an integer (whole number) using the `int()` function.  Try it in your console.

        ```
        >>> print(2 + int("2"))
        4
        ```

        <br>
        We can also fix the `1/2 = 0` error in the previous example.  
        When Python divides two integers, it doesn&rsquo;t know that the answer isn&rsquo;t an integer so it gets confused. 

        Integer **types** don&rsquo;t have decimal parts, so we have to convert to a more precise type, in this case **floats** since this number **type** can handle decimals.
        ```
        >>> print(float(1) / float(2))
        0.5
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Typecasting (Continued)

        Python can also be used to convert numbers to strings.

        ```
        >>> print(99 + " bottles of beer on the wall")
        Traceback (most recent call last):
        File "<input>", line 1, in <module>
        TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects

        ```
        Use the `str()` function to convert a number to a string.

        ```
        >>> print(str(99) + " bottles of beer on the wall")

        ```

        The ability to tell Python to change the type will come in handy later.

<!-- -------------------- -->
<!--Variables-->
<!-- -------------------- -->

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Variables
        * In programming, we usually want to store a value to use later
        * Variables store data in your computer&rsquo;s memory and you use a **variable name** to fetch their value (kind of like a bookmark in a book)
        * Use the equal (`=`) symbol to assign a value to a variable

        ```python
        >>> x = 5
        >>> y = 4
        >>> x * y
        20
        ```

        ```python
        >>> today = "Saturday"
        >>> print("Today is " + today)
        Today is Saturday
        ```
        You can store almost anything in a variable. 
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Reassigning Variables

        Variables can be changed after you&rsquo;ve assigned the value by "reassigning" them.

        ```python
        # Remember, we've already set x = 5 and y = 4
        >>> y = 10
        >>> x * y
        ```

        What do you think the value of `x * y` will be? <span class="delayed">50</span>

        Why?  
        You changed <!-- .element: class="delayed" -->`y`, but the old value of `x` is still in memory.   
        Python will remember variable names until you close PyCharm or [clear them manually](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#the-del-statement).

      <script type="text/template">
        ## Pro Tip! Use Comments

        * Programmers use *comments* to leave notes for themselves (and other people reading their code in the future)
        * Good comments add information that isn&rsquo;t immediately obvious
        * You&rsquo;ll see more comments throughout the exercises
        * Feel free to add your own!

<!-- Exercise 1: Hello World -->
<!-- -------------------- -->

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Class Exercise 1: Hello World

        We&rsquo;ve already used the console to put a 'Hello World' message on the screen, so why not take it one step further and have Python say hello to anyone?

        Python has a `raw_input()` function that gets data typed by a user and **returns** that value to you.

        1. You give `raw_input()` a message to let your user know what you&rsquo;re looking for
        1. The user types something and hits the **enter** key
        1. Whatever the user types is **returned** to you.

        Let&rsquo;s try it in your console:

        ```python
        >>> raw_input("What's your name?")
        ```
        It outputs `What's your name?`

        You type in your name, press **enter**, and it will print it out on the next line.
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Class Exercise 1: Hello World (part 2)

        Typing into the console is fine to start, but do you really want to type your program every time you run it?

        Python can run your code from a file with a `.py` **extension**  
        *(<!-- .element: class="footnote" -->the letters after `.` in a filename tell your computer which program can run it)*

        Let&rsquo;s create our first Python file!

        1. Right-click on the **exercises** folder to create a new file.   
          Then select **New > Python File**

          ![Create a new Python File](./framework/img/workshop/new-file-mac.png)

        1. Enter the name `ex1_hello_world.py` in the popup box.

          ![new python file name](framework/img/workshop/new-python-file.png)

        1. Now we can add our simple program to the file

          ```python
          # Assign the raw_input value to a variable
          # Your program waits for the user to hit enter
          name = raw_input("Please enter your name: ")

          # … then continues to this line
          print("Hello " + name)
          ```

        Now how do we get PyCharm to run this file?
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Class Exercise 1: Hello World (part 3)

        Code in a file is just text until you **run** it through the Python program.

        1. To run the code saved in your file, select **Run > Run&hellip;**  

          ![](framework/img/workshop/pycharm-run.png)  
        *<!-- .element: class="footnote" -->Note: PyCharm automatically saves your file before you run it.*

        1. Click on `ex1_hello_world` (again) in the menu popup that appears in the middle of the screen.  

          ![Click to run your program](./framework/img/workshop/run-mini-menu.png)

        1. Now click into the console window that opened, type your name and press the **Enter** key. You should see your name repeated back at you.

          ![Demo of hello_world example](./framework/img/workshop/ex1-hello-world.png)

        1. You can run your program as many times as you like by repeating the steps above.

        ## Conditionals &amp; Logic
        * The program we just wrote ran straight from top to bottom
        * What if the program could act differently and decide what to do?
        * Use conditionals like an `if` statement
        * Each `if` statement contains a test, and the indented block is the code that will run if the test is `True` but not if it is `False` and looks something like this:

            wear a sweater
        else:
            dress normally :)
        ```

        You can also have more than one condition.

        ```python
        # Still not real code
        if it is cold outside:
            wear a sweater
        elif it is raining:

        How does `if` know what&rsquo;s `True` or `False`? We use 'Boolean' statements to test against values.

        Reminder, one equals symbol only *assigns* a value to the variable.

        ```python
        >>> weather = "raining"
        ```

        Test the values. The double equals symbol (`==`) will evaluate if the value on the right matches the assigned value.
        ```
        >>> weather == "cold"
        False
        >>> weather == "raining"
        True
        ```
        We can use these *statements* with our `if` values to test for our weather conditions

        ## Class Exercise 2: Weather

        Create a new file `ex2_weather_advice.py` and write out the code snippet below (avoid the temptation of copy-paste).

        Note the syntax and **indentation** (whitespace is very important in Python). Try to understand each line as you type it.

        ```python
        # file: ex2_weather_advice.py
        weather = raw_input("What is the weather? (cold, raining, etc.)")

        if weather == "cold":
            print("Wear a sweater!")
        elif weather == "raining":
            print("Bring an umbrella")
        else:
            print("Dress normally :)")
        ```

        Try running your file a few times to get different advice (the weather is so unpredictable!)

        **Bonus: ** Update the conditions or add more conditions.

        ## Indentation

        Python uses indentation to figure out which 'block' of code belongs inside the `if` or `else`.

        When you're typing out examples that use an `if` or `else` in the console, you'll see this:

        ```python
        >>> if weather == "cold":
        ... ̺̺̺̺
        ```

        The `...` and auto-indentation is the console signalling that it expects the nested block code.  
        When you're done, press enter twice (or backspace and type `else:` and you'll get your next indented block).

        ```python
        >>> if weather == "cold":
        ...     print("Wear a sweater!")
        ... else:
        ... print("Dress normally :)")
        File "<input>", line 5
            print("Dress normally :)")

        ## Opening a file

        We typically store computer data in files. The data in some files is human-readable text (while in others, like images, it&rsquo;s in a format that&rsquo;s only readable by programs with specific code to interpret the data).

        It&rsquo;s fairly easy in Python to open a human-readable file and print the contents to the screen.

        ```python
        >>> chapters = open('./exercises/llc-chapters.csv')
        >>> print(chapters.read())
        # … lots of file data …
        >>> chapters.close()
        # When you're done with a file it's a good idea to close it
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## One line at a time

        In order to make use of the data in a file, we need to make sense of small portions at a time.

        In the `llc-chapters.csv` file, each line of the file represents a Ladies Learning Code Chapter

        Let&rsquo;s print out a few individual lines

        ```python
        >>> chapters = open('./exercises/llc-chapters.csv')
        >>> print(chapters.readline())
        City,Province,Chapter Lead(s)

        >>> print(chapters.readline())
        Vancouver,BC,Meghan

        >>> print(chapters.readline())
        Calgary,AB,Darcie

        >>> chapters.close()
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## Comma-Separated Values (CSV) Files

        In the previous slide we printed out three lines in the file, one at a time.

        ```
        City,Province,Chapter Lead(s)
        Vancouver,BC,Meghan
        Calgary,AB,Darcie
        ```

        Notice that all three lines have exactly three values, separated by a comma (`,`)

        The first line doesn&rsquo;t tell us about a chapter, it has headings than describe the data in the next lines

        The second and third line each represent one of the LLC chapters.

        This is a specific *file format* called **CSV** (short for *comma-separated values*) that is used to represent spreadsheet-like data

        This is a widely used file-format because it&rsquo;s such a simple representation of rows and columns of data. It doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you&rsquo;re on a Mac, Windows, Linux or even on a web app like Google Docs – everyone can use this data.

        ## Reading all the lines in a file

        It&rsquo;s all well and good to print out the lines in a file one-at-a-time while you&rsquo;re learning, but surely, there&rsquo;s a better way to read *all* the lines in a file.

        In programming, when you want to perform the same action many times in a row, we use **loops**. In Python, the main kind of loop is the `for` loop.

        If we want to print each of the rows in our file, we can use the following code:

        ```python
        >>> chapters = open('./exercises/llc-chapters.csv')
        >>> for line in chapters:
        ...     print(line)
        ... 
        >>> chapters.close()
        ```

    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        ## `for` loop behind the scenes

        If you play around with the `chapters` variable in your console, you might notice that it has a `.next()` function which does the same thing as `.readline()`

        `for` can work with many different collections of data, all it&rsquo;s looking for is that `.next()` function.

        Behind the scenes, it&rsquo;s doing something roughly like

        ```python
        line = chapters.next()
        # Execute your code block
        # …
        # Go back to get the next value and repeat until there are no more values
        ```

        We&rsquo;ll use the `for` loop in our future exercises to work with a larger file.

        ## Libraries

        Python has wonderful built in **libraries** which are collections of code that other people have written. Today we&rsquo;ll use the **csv** library. It contains instructions that tell python how to work with CSV files.

        This library will help us makes sense of the data contained in a CSV file to learn more about LLC activities in 2014.

      <script type="text/template">
        ## Reading data from a CSV file

        The CSV libary has a number of different tools for extracting actual data from a CSV file.

        Whereas before we were looking at the whole line, with the CSV library we can get individual pieces of data (like the cells of a spreadsheet)

        Today we&rsquo;ll mostly be using the `DictReader` tool because it makes it easier to understand the data in each row (without remembering anything about the headings)

        * First we open the file  

          ```
          >>> chapters_file = open('llc-chapters.csv')
          ```
        * Then, we import the `csv` library and pass it a reference to our file  

          ```
          >>> import csv
          >>> chapters_data = csv.DictReader(chapters_file)
          ```
        * Now, we can pull out one row at a time  

          ```
          >>> chapter = chapters_data.next()
          >>> print(chapter)
          {'City': 'Vancouver', 'Chapter Lead(s)': 'Meghan', 'Province': 'BC'}

        This time, when we printed the values from the CSV file, instead of getting comma-separated values, we got a `dict`ionary representing each row in the file.

        Instead of having to remember which *column* represents city, we can access it with a keyword:

        ```python
        >>> chapter = {'City': 'Vancouver', 'Chapter Lead(s)': 'Meghan', 'Province': 'BC'}

        ## Counting loops

        Sometimes you want to keep track of the number of times something happened. 

        We can add `1` to the current value of a variable, and assign it back to the same variable. Python processes everything to the right of the `=` before assignining the result.

        ```python
        >>> count = 0
        >>> count = count + 1
        >>> print(count)
        1
        ```
        We can count the number of chapters in **llc-chapters.csv** if we increase by one each time it loops.

        ```python
        # file: exercises/demo_loop_count.py
        import csv

        csv_file = open('../exercises/llc-chapters.csv')
        csv_data = csv.DictReader(csv_file)

        count = 0
        for row in csv_data:
            count += 1

        print("There are " + str(count) + " chapters")

        ## Finding a word in a string

        So far, we've compared entire strings to each other `"Python" == "Python"`.

        But what if you want to find a word inside an existing string?

        Python has a `.find()` function available on `str` types that tells you where another string appears – its **index**.

        ```python
        >>> "Ladies Learning Code".find("Code")
        16
        >>> title = "National Learn to Code Day"
        >>> title.find("Code")
        18
        >>> title.find("code")
        -1
        ```

        The `.find()` function is case-sensitive – it will only match the *exact* string you pass it, even if the only difference is `C` vs `c`.  
        *<!-- .element: class="footnote" --> When we said computers require **exact** instructions, we meant it!*

        ## Exercise 4: Find chapters with co-leads (10 mins)

        Now that you know how to find a string within a string, we can figure out which cities have co-leads.

        If you open the **llc-chapters.csv** file you can see that we *always* use the `&` character to separate co-lead names.

        Remember, `.find()` returns the index of the search string in the other string **or** `-1` to signal nothing was found. We can use the `>=` symbol to determine if the string was found.

        ```python
        >>> leads = "Nancy & Cassie"
        >>> if leads.find("&") >= 0:
        ...     print(leads + " are co-leads")
        ... 
        Nancy & Cassie are co-leads
        ```

        Use this pattern to print a list of cities with co-leads and count how many there are.
