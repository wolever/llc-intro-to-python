        #Your first Python program!

        Our first program is going to do three things: 

        1. Ask for some input from the user of the program (that&rsquo;s you!)
        2. Store the information the user gives in a **variable**.
        3. Output information so the user can see it.

        We&rsquo;ll write our program in a file called **ex1_hello.py**.

        #Class Exercise 1: Write your first Python program!

        Here&rsquo;s what to do:

        1. Go to **File > New** to create a new .py file.
        2. Go to **File > Save As...** and save the file as **ex1_hello.py** in the **exercises** folder.
        3. Type the following two lines of code **exactly** as written:

        ```python
        name = raw_input('What is your name? ')
        print('Hello ' + name)
        ```

        4. Click the green "Run" button.
        5. Type your name (or anything, really) at the prompt in the "Python Shell" part of the screen.

        note:

        Encourage learners to type out code in full instead of copy+pasting it
        so their fingers get practice typing the programming-specific
        characters.

        #How did that go??

        First of all, you may have got some errors. This is a **PERFECTLY NORMAL** part of programming. Computers aren&rsquo;t as smart as you.

        Humans can read something that doesn&rsquo;t quite follow the rules of the language. Computers can&rsquo;t. Some typos in that code would cause it not to work (e.g., missing a ")" or misspelling "print").

        Luckily, Python tries to help us figure out what happened. Error messages contain information about where an error occurred, and what kind of error it was. With practice, you can learn to read them:

        ```
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "/Users/wolever/sandbox.py", line 3, in <module>
            print('Hello, + name)

        #What did we just do?

        You just wrote your first program!

        It contains 2 lines of code, and a bunch of different programming concepts:

        * functions: `raw_input` and `print`
        * variables: `name`
        * strings: `'What is your name?'` and `'Hello'` (your name was stored as a string too)

        #Functions &amp; Variables

        In programming, we want to be able to take some of the work we&rsquo;ve done and store it somewhere for later, with a name or label to refer to it by. 

        * Variables refer to pieces of information that we want to work with. In this example, the variable `name` was used to refer to whatever you entered as your name. 
        * Functions refer to chunks of code. In this example, we used the `print` and `raw_input` functions. There are LOTS of functions that already exist in Python, and we'll use some of them today.

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #More on Functions

        * Functions are bundles of instructions that can be re-used
        * Reusing functions helps to reduce redundancy
        * Function can take **arguments** and can **return** values

        ```
        #      v--- function
        name = raw_input('What is your name? ')
        #    arguments --^
        ```
        
        It&rsquo;s possible to create your own, but today&rsquo;s exercises will use functions provided by Python and its libraries.

        #Functions we just used

        We used two functions in our first program:

        1. `print`: We&rsquo;ll use this one a lot today to see the result of whatever we just computed. Notice how we put quotes around `'Hello '` and not around `name` in our program. In general, put quotes around things you want to be printed exactly as is, and no quotes around variables.

        2. `raw_input`: This function pauses the program and waits for the user to type something. This is useful for now, but we will soon look at a better way to get information into our programs.

        #Reassigning Variables

        Variables can be changed after the initial declaration by "reassigning" them.

        We could change our original program to:

        ```python
        name = raw_input('What is your name? ')
        print('I think ' + name + ' is not your real name...')
        name = raw_input('What is your real name? ')
        print('Hello ' + name)
        ```

        We are using the same variable <code>name</code> to refer to the second thing entered as well. 

        Note that when we change a variable, we lose the old thing it referred to. Just make sure that is what you want to do!

        Here are some tips & best practices for creating variable names:
        
        * variable names can only use letters, numbers and the underscore (`_`)
          * no spaces!
        * separate words with the underscore `_` symbol
          * e.g. `ladies_learning_code`
        * they cannot begin with a number
          * e.g. `1day` gives you an error, `day1` will work.
        * descriptive names will make future you happier
          * e.g. `first_name` is more descriptive than `fn`

        * String (`str`, words, sentences, literal text)

        #Concatenation

        **Concatenation** is a fancy word for "joining strings together".

        ```python
        print("Hello " + "World!") # --> prints Hello World!
        ```

        But what if we try to join a string and a number?

        ```python
        print(2 + "2")
        ```

        We&rsquo;ll get an error, something like this:
        ```
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File ".../sandbox.py", line 3, in <module>
            print(2 + '2')
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Why did that error happen?

        Python needs to know the data **type** to work with it.  
        
        Let&rsquo;s look at that error again.

        ```python
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File ".../sandbox.py", line 3, in <module>
            print(2 + '2')
        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'str'
        ```
        
        The first `2` is an `int` and the second `'2'` is a `str`.

        Python doesn&rsquo;t know whether you wanted to *add two numbers* or
        *concatenate two strings*. Instead of guessing, it forces you to be
        **explicit**.

        note:

        You can use phone numbers as an example of example of something which
        looks like a number, but it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to perform mathmatical
        operations on.

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Typecasting
        
        Sometimes we need to convert - or *cast* - a value from one type to another.

        In this example, if we want to add two numbers, we can *cast* the
        string `'2'` to an integer using the `int(…)` function:

        ```
        print(2 + int('2')) # --> prints 4
        ```

        We could also concatenate two strings by casting the integer `2` to a
        string with the `str(…)` function:

        ```
        print(str(2) + '2') # --> prints 22
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Typecasting (Continued)

        We can use the same functions to change the types of variables:

        ```python
        first_number = raw_input('Enter a number: ')
        second_number = raw_input('Enter another number: ')
        product = int(first_number) * int(second_number)
        print(first_number + ' times ' + second_number + ' is: ' + str(product))
        ```

        The ability to tell Python to change the type will come in handy later.

        #Pro Tip: use `repr` to figure out a variable's type!

        Sometimes you may not be sure what type of value you have:

        ```python
        print(x) # prints 42
        ```

        Is `x` an integer or a string? Who knows!

        Fortunately Python has a function called `repr` which will return a
        string *representing* the value:

        ```python
        print(repr(42)) # prints 42
        print(repr('42')) # prints '42'

        a = 'hello'
        print(repr(a)) # prints 'hello'

        #Conditionals &amp; Logic

        So far our programs have run once, top to bottom. What if the program could decide what to do instead?

        `if` statements can be used to execute different sets of instructions based on specific conditions.

        Each `if` statement contains a *test*. The indented block of code will run if the test is `True`:

        ```python
        if weather == 'cold':
            print('Wear a sweater!')
        ```

        `elif` statemens can be added after an `if` statement to test for other things:

        ```python
        if weather == 'cold':
            print('Wear a sweater!')
        elif weather == 'raining':
            print('Bring an umbrella')
        ```

        And a final `else` statement can be added, which run if none of the `if` or `elif` tests before it passed:

        ```python
        if weather == 'cold':
            print('Wear a sweater!')
        elif weather == 'raining':
            print('Bring an umbrella')
        else:
            print('Dress normally :)')
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Indentation

        Notice that we *indent* the instructions inside the body of the `if` statement.

        Python gets *very* particular about this indentation. For example:

        ```python
        if weather == 'cold':
            print('Wear a sweater!')
        else:
        print('Dress normally :)')
        ```

        Produces the error:
        ```python
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File ".../sandbox.py", line 4, in <module>
            print('Dress normally :)')
        IndentationError: expected an indented block (2, line 4)
        ```

        If the body of the statement contains multiple lines of code, they must
        be indented to the same level. For example:

        ```python
        if weather == 'cold':
            print('It will be cold today...')
              print('Wear a sweater!')
        ```

        Will produce the error:

        ```
        Traceback (most recent call last):
          File "/Users/wolever/sandbox.py", line 3, in <module>
            print('Wear a sweater!')

        #Equality

        What's that `==` doing? It's the *equality operator*, read "equals".

        It evalutes to `True` if the left hand side is equal to the right hand side:

        ```
        weather = "raining"
        print(weather == "cold") # --> prints False
        print(weather == "raining") # --> prints True
        ```

        The `!=` operator — read "not equals" — does the opposite:

        ```
        print(4 != 3) # --> prints True
        print(4 != 4) # --> prints False
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Equality continued...

        Reminder: one equals sign is used for *assignment*, two for *equality*.

        This assigns the value `"raining"` to the variable `weather`:
        ```python
        weather = "raining"
        ```

        This compares the variable `weather` to the string `"raining"`:
        ```python
        weather == "raining"
        ```

        Make a guess at each of these questions then try it to see if you&rsquo;re right:

        * Does case matter? (does `"david" == "David"`?)
        * What happens when numbers and strings are compared? (does `4 == "4"`?)
        * What happens when `float`s and `int`s are compared? (does `float(4) == int(4)`)?

        #Pro Tip: Comments!

        Programmers use *comments* to leave notes for themselves (and other people reading their code in the future):

        ```
        # This is a comment! Python will ignore everything after a #
        ```
        
        Good comments add information that isn&rsquo;t immediately obvious:

        ```python
        # subtract 32 from f then multiply by 5/9 <--- not a helpful comment
        c = (f - 32) * 5/9

        # convert a temperature in ºF to ºC       <--- a helpful comment
        c = (f - 32) * 5/9
        ```
        
        You can also use comments to organize your code or to &rsquo;hide&rsquo; chunks of code you don&rsquo;t want to delete but are not ready to use yet.

        We&rsquo;ll also be using the mathematical greater than and less than operators:

        `>`, `>=`: greater than, greater than or equal to<br />
        `<`, `<=`: less than, less than or equal to

        ```python
        print(5 > 4) # prints True

        #Getting MORE data into our programs

        So far, we have provided all of the input to our program by typing it in when the `raw_input` function was called. 

        This is *NOT* how we want to do things when we have lots of data!

        Now we will look at reading data from files into our programs. What we do today will work for any kind of **plain-text** file, like .txt, .csv, and so on.

        #Opening a file
        
        Computer data is often stored in files such **.csv** (comma-separated values) files.  
        These file types are used to represent spreadsheet-like data.
        
        Let&rsquo;s look at the example below to see how to open these files in Python and print the contents to the screen. 
        
        In your `sandbox.py`, try adding the below commands.

        ```python
        weather_file = open('./simple_weather.csv')
        print(weather_file.read())
        ```

        When you run this, you should see a lot of stuff printed:

        ```
        Month,temp,condition
        Jan,cold,snowing
        ...
        ```

        If you get a "No such file or directory" error, double check that you've
        opened the `sandbox.py` file in the `exercises` folder.

        * the first line shows the headings that describe the data in the next lines
        * the second and third line each represent one weather record

        #Loops: Reading all the lines in a file
        
        We&rsquo;ve just seen how to print out the entire file, but what if we want to do something with each line?

        In programming, we use *loops* to run the same instructions multiple times.

        In Python, we can use a `for` loop to print each line of a file:

        ```python
        weather_file = open('./simple_weather.csv')
        for line in weather_file:
            print(line)
        ```

        Notice that the body of the `for` loop needs to be indented (just like
        the body of an `if` statement).

        #Checking for text in a line

        It's often useful to check to see whether a string contains another string.

        To do this, we can use the `in` operator to produce a `True` or `False` value.

        For example, the code `"sunny" in line` will be True if `"sunny"` is part of the text on `line`:

        ```python
        line = "it is sunny today"
        print("sunny" in line) # prints True
        ```

        We can use this with an if statement too:

        ```python
        if "sunny" in line:
          print("It's sunny today!")
        # prints It's sunny today!

        #Breaking Lines into Pieces

        What if we only wanted to print part of a line?

        We're going to need a couple of new things:

        1. Some way to split a string into pieces. We're going to use Python's `.split(…)` function.

        2. A new type which can hold those pieces and let us access them individually. Python calls this a `list`.

        Here's how we can split the string `"Feb,cold,sunny"` on the commas:

        ```python
        data = 'Feb,cold,sunny'.split(',')
        print(data) # --> prints ['Feb', 'cold', 'sunny']
        ```

        The `.split(…)` function breaks up the string by its argument — in this
        case a comma — and returns a `list` containing the parts.

        note:

        Mention that this kind of function is also called a method, and that
        there are differences between the two, but for now we'll just call
        them functions.

        #Accessing List Elements

        Once we have the list — `["Feb", "cold", "sunny"]` — we can access the individual elements.

        We do this by *indexing* into the list, putting the element *index* we want inside square braces:

        ```
        data = ["Feb", "cold", "sunny"]
        print(data[1]) # prints cold

        ```python
        data = ["Feb", "cold", "sunny"]

        #Class Exercise 5

        The file `big_weather.csv` contains the temperature for different days of different months:

        ```csv
        Thursday,January,1,-3.9
        Friday,January,2,-2.3
        Saturday,January,3,-0.4
        Sunday,January,4,0.2
        ...
        ```

        Open `ex5_big_weather.py` and modify it to use your temperature-based
        recommendation algorithm from exercise 3 to make a recommendation for
        each day in `big_weather.csv`.

        For example:

        ```
        Friday July 26 will be -4: better bundle up!
        Tuesday February 11 will be 8: wear a sweater and dream of beaches
        Thursday February 19 will be 0: better bundle up!
        ...
        ```

        Remember that we can use `int("4")` to convert from a string to an
        integer, and `str(6)` to convert from an integer to a string!

        recommendations for weekends.

        Lists are *super* useful, and it's worth getting to know them a bit

        temperatures.append(4)
        temperatures.append(-2)
        temperatures.append(6)

        Python has some functions that do different operations on lists of numbers.

        ```python
        temperatures = [4, -2, 6]
        max_temp = max(temperatures) # careful about naming variables 'max'

        Python doesn't come with a function for finding the average (mean) value of a list, but we can use the `len` (length) function to do that ourselves:

        ```python
        average = sum(temperatures) / len(temperatures)
        print average # prints 2
        ```

        note:

        <p>
          In the afternoon, we're going to drop the parens around print(…)
          so we can print things without wrapping everything in str(…).
        </p>

        <p>
          Make a note of this to the learners, and explain that "print is just
          a little bit magic so uh don't worry about why you can give it
          lots of arguments without the parens.

        # Floats and decimal numbers

        The mathematically inclined among you might have noticed that the mean of 4, -2, and 6 is not 2, but 2⅔! What gives?

        This is where the `float` — floating point number — type comes into play.

        In Python, when you divide two integers (whole numbers) you always get a whole number back:

        ```
        print 2 / 3 # prints 0
        ```

        To get the decimal number you expect, at least one of the two numbers being divided must be a `float`:

        ```
        print 2 / float(3) # prints 0.6666666666666666
        ```

        You can also signal to Python that a number you've typed is a float by adding an explicit decimal place:

        ```
        print 1 / 2.0 # prints 0.5
        ```

        So to get the average as a decimal, we can use:

        ```python
        average = sum(temperatures) / float(len(temperatures))
        print average # prints 2
        ```

        #Class Exercise 5 (continued): 

        Add to your code in `ex5_big_weather.py` to also find the average temperature over all days in the file.

        For example:

        ```
        Average temperature: 9.41

        #Counting loops

        Sometimes you want to keep track of the number of times something happened. 

        We can do this by adding `1` to a variable, then assigning that back to the same variable:

        ```python
        count = 0
        count = count + 1  # or, you can write count += 1
        print count # prints 1
        ```
        
        Count the number of lines in **big_weather.csv** by adding one each time it loops.

        ```python
        weather_file = open('big_weather.csv')

        line_count = 0
        for line in weather_file:
            line_count = line_count + 1

        print "There are", line_count, "lines!"
        ```
      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Counting loops

        In fact, adding a number to a variable and assigning the result back to
        that variable is so common that we can use `+=`:

        ```python
        count = 0
        count += 1 # exactly the same as count = count + 1
        print count # prints 1
        ```
        
        And we could re-write the line counting loop:

        ```python
        ...

        line_count = 0
        for line in weather_file:
            line_count += 1

        ...
        ```
      </script>

      # Counting multiple things

      What if there are multiple things we want to count?

      Count the number of lines for each month in **big_weather.csv**.

      ```python
      jan_count = 0
      feb_count = 0
      # ... and so on ...
      for line in weather_file:
        if "Jan" in line:
          jan_count += 1
        if "Feb" in line:
          feb_count += 1
        # ... and so on ...

        #Dictionaries
        
        Along with numbers, strings, and lists, dictionaries — `dict`s — are one of Python&rsquo;s fundamental types.

        Dictionaries associate *keys* with *values*:

        ```python
        person = {'name': 'David Wolever', 'twitter': '@wolever', 'following': 735}
        ```

        And similar to lists, we use *square braces* to look up the value associated with a key:

        ```python
        print person['name'] # prints David Wolever
        print person['following'] # prints 735
        ```

      </script>
    </section>

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        #Counting with Dictionaries
        
        In addition to reading values from dictionaries you can also assign to
        them, just like you would with variables:

        ```python
        counts = {}
        counts['a'] = 0
        print counts # prints {'a': 0}
        counts['a'] += 1
        print counts # prints {'a': 1}
        ```

        And you can use the `in` operator to see if a particular key is `in`
        the dictionary:

        ```
        counts = {'a': 1}
        print 'a' in counts # prints True
        print 'b' in counts # prints False
        ```

        #Counting things you don&rsquo;t expect!

        So far we have had to define one variable for each "thing" we wanted to count… but what happens when we can&rsquo;t do that ahead of time?

        For example, what happens if we want to count the number of weather records for each month?
        
        We can use dictionaries!

        ```python
        weather_file = open('big_weather.csv')
        month_counts = {}
        for line in weather_file:
          month = line.strip().split(',')[1]
          if month in month_counts:
            month_counts[month] += 1
          else:
            month_counts[month] = 1
        print month_counts
        # prints {'February': 28, 'October': 31, ...}

      #Writing to files

      So far everything we did went to the screen. This might be enough for you, but you can also write your own files.

      To tell `open` that we intend to write to the file, we add a `"w"` argument:

      ```python
      new_file = open("my_new_file.csv", "w")
      ```

      (warning: `open` will clear the file when we open it for writing!)

      Then we use the `.write(…)` function to write strings to the file:

      ```python
      new_file.write(line_to_write + "\n") # "\n" is like hitting Enter after each line
      ```

      Finally, we need to `.close()` the file to signal that we&rsquo;re finished writing to it:

      ```
      new_file.close()
      ```
      </script>
    </section>    

    <section class="slide" data-markdown>
      <script type="text/template">
        # Writing our own CSV files!

        Once we&rsquo;ve got our data processed it&rsquo;s often useful load it into
        another tool, and saving it to a CSV file is often the simplest way to
        do that.

        Python provides a `.join(…)` function which makes this easy:

        ```
        month = "January"
        average_temp = 0.5
        row = [month, str(average_temp)] # the float needs to become a string
        print ",".join(row) # prints January,0.5
        ```

        And we can combine that with `.write(…)` like this:

        ```
        new_file = open("my_new_file.csv", "w")
        new_file.write(",".join(row) + "\n")
        new_file.close()
        ```

        (You may notice that you run into problems if you&rsquo;re saving data that
        contains a comma - see the *Reference: the `csv` Library* slide for a more robust
        way to read and write CSV files)

        #Final Exercise!

        Your final project will be to learn something about a dataset. We have provided a few for you, and some questions to get you started, but feel free to try something else!

        `../datasets/llc-workshop-data.csv`: This dataset represents the people who participated in Ladies Learning Code events in 2015. Some things to find out:

          * How many people signed up for "National Learn to Code Day"?
          * Total number of people registered in youth-oriented "National Learn to Code Day" (ie. "Kids" and "Girls")

        `../datasets/historic-sites.csv`: This dataset represents the names and locations of historic sites in Canada.

          * How many are in each province? (Watch for some bad data...)
          * What is the name of the northernmost historic site?

        You can find these and more datasets in the **datasets** folder. See **datasets/README.txt** for more information about each dataset.

        #Bonus Exercise: Open Data Hackathon

        You can find a few more datasets in the `datasets` folder. Most of this data came from open.canada.ca, where you can find more data than you can handle!
        
        **Pro tip!** Open the .csv data in a program like Excel, [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/), Google Spreadsheet, or Plot.ly to see the data.
        
        * Can you identify any interesting patterns?
        * What are you interested in learning from the data?
        * What do you want the output to be?
        
        Take the consumer vehicle [Fuel Consumption Ratings](http://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/98f1a129-f628-4ce4-b24d-6f16bf24dd64).

        # Reference: the `csv` library

        You may have noticed that reading and writing CSVs using `.split(…)`
        and `.join(…)` breaks if the data contains a comma.

        Python has a built-in library which can help with this!

        The `csv.reader` function can be used to read from files:

        ```python
        import csv

        weather_file = csv.reader(open('big_weather.csv'))
        for row in weather_file:
            print row # prints ['Thursday', 'January', '1', '-3.9']
        ```

        And if your CSV file has a header row:

        ```
        Month,temp,condition
        Jan,cold,snowing
        ...
        ```

        The `csv.DictReader` function will return dictionaries instead of lists:

        ```python
        import csv

        weather_file = csv.DictReader(open('simple_weather.csv'))
        for row in weather_file:
          print row # prints {'Month': 'Jan', 'temp': 'cold', 'condition': 'snowing'}
        ```

        The `csv.writer` function can be used to write to them

        ```python
        import csv

        new_file = open("my_new_file.csv", "w")
        new_file_writer = csv.writer(new_file)
        new_file_writer.writerow(["this,has,commas", "another,column"])
        new_file.close()
        ```

        Will write:

        ```
        "this,has,commas","another,column"
        ```
